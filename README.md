# Overview

This is a simple web app that allows a user to create posts, or notes. They contain a title, body, and date created, and can be deleted. This app was developed for the purpose of learning a little bit about Django and web app development. 

To start the app, run 'python manage.py runserver' on the command line after you cd into notetaker.
